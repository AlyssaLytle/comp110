# Instructions

Write a function definition with the following expectations:

- The function name is `zip` and is called with a `list[str]` and `list[int]` as arguments.
- The function should return a `dict[str,int]`.
- The function should produce a dictionary where the *keys* are the items of the first list and the *values* are the corresponding items at the same index of the second list.
- If the input lists are different lengths or if they are empty, the function should return an empty dictionary.
- The function should not mutate (modify) the input lists.
- Explicitly type variables, parameters, and return types. (The autograder won't check for this, but it's good practice for the quiz!)
- Save your file as zip.py.


Upload your `zip.py` file to the autograder on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). **You do not have to compress anything using the `submission` script! Just drag and drop the one zip.py file!**
