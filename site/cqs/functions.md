# Functions Challenge Question

For this challenge question, you are going to practice both writing functions and `while` loops!

## Part 0. Setup

Start by opening your workspace in Visual Studio. Right click on the "lessons" folder and select "add file". Your file will be named `evens_function.py`.

Set up your document by adding a docstring and initializing the `__author__` variable with your PID.

## Part 1. `display_evens()`

Now, write a function called `display_evens` that takes as input an integer and does the following:

- prints all even numbers less than or equal to that input number in decreasing order down to 0 and 
- returns the original number.

For example, `get_evens(6)` should print:

`6`

`4`

`2`

`0`

and return the value `6`.


## Submission

Create a .zip file by running the following command in your terminal:

```python -m tools.submission lessons/evens_function.py```

Then, drag and drop that .zip file into Gradescope!
