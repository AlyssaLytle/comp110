## Introduction and Setup

These Challenge Questions are designed to help you implement some of the concepts you've learned on small problems before you handle larger problems in your exercises!

To start, right click in the "Explorer" pane of your workspace and select "New Folder...". Name this new folder `CQs`. This is where you will be writing and storing your challenge questions this semester!

Now, right click on your "CQs" folder and select "New File...". Name this file `cq00_functions.py`. *The `.py` at the end of the file name is necessary, or your program won't run!*
