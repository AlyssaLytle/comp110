# Unit Test Challenge Question

For this challenge question, you are going to *test* the functions we just wrote in class!

## Part 0. Setup

Start by opening your workspace in Visual Studio. Right click on the "lessons" folder and select "add file". Your file will be named `garden_helpers_test.py`.

Set up your document by adding the docstring:
`"""Test my garden functions."""` and initializing the `__author__` variable with your PID.

Also don't forget to import your functions from `lessons.garden_helpers`!

## Part 1-3. unit tests

Write 2 unit tests for each of the 3 functions defined in class. Remember that a unit test function name starts with `test_`.

The 2 unit tests should consist of:

* One edge case
* One use case

Include descriptive function names and docstrings, so that it captures what is being tested.


## Submission

Create a .zip file by running the following command in your terminal:

```python -m tools.submission lessons```

(For this assignment, you'll have to submit your entire lessons folder! Gradescope will give you the option to select what files to delete within that folder by clicking an "x". Make sure you include garden_helpers_test.py and garden_helpers.py!)

Then, drag and drop that .zip file into Gradescope!
