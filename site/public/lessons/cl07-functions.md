## Today's Responsess on Gradescope

Today's video responses are contained in a single lesson on Gradescope and correspond to the videos below. You should watch them in order and make it a point to pause and attempt each item _before_ watching the solution.

If you do not complete all videos in one sitting, you can reopen your submission on Gradescope to finish it out before the deadline. To do so, open your submission and look for a button in the bottom of your screen for "Create New Submission".
