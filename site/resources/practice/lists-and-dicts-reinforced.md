## List General Questions
1. The following questions will refer to the list below:
```python
my_list: list[int] = list()
```
- 1a. Write line(s) of code that would add the number `8`, `0`, `3`, and `-1` to the list. 
- 1b. Write line(s) of code that removes `3` from the list.
- 1c. Write line(s) of code that assigns the variable `dog` to the element at the second index.
- 1d. Write line(s) of code that prints the amount of items in the list. 
- 1e. We now have a function, `sum` that adds the elements of my_list and returns this amount. Write a line of code that instantiates a `list[int]` with the first value returned from calling `sum` on `my_list`.
