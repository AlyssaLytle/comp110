Solutions for each problem can be found at the bottom of this page.

## Conceptual Questions

1. A class definition provides a pattern for creating objects, but doesn’t make any objects itself. (T/F)
2. By convention, Python class names start with a lowercase letter. (T/F)
3. When you define a method in a class, all objects of that class have that method associated with it. (T/F)
4. The first parameter of a method is a copy of the object the method is called on. (T/F)
5. A class definition must come before an object of that class is instantiated. (T/F)
6. You must have an instance of a class (an object) to call the class’s constructor. (T/F)
7. Constructors must have the `self` parameter in their signature. (T/F)
8. Constructors must take at least one parameter other than the self parameter. (T/F)
9. Objects are passed into functions by reference. (T/F)
10. The type of an object is the same as the name of the class it is an instance of. (T/F)

## Class Writing

1. This class is slightly challenging, but take it step by step! Create a `ChristmasTreeFarm` class with the following specifications:
    a. The `ChristmasTreeFarm` class should have one attribute: a `list[int]` named `plots`. 
        * Basic behavior of `plots` (you will define this later):
            * This list will hold values that represent the size of the tree planted in each plot. 
            * If the value at an index of the list is 0, then the plot at that index is empty (does not have a tree). 
            * Any value other than 0 indicates that a tree is growing in that plot!
    b. The *constructor* for the class should take two arguments: `plots: int` and `initial_planting: int`, both of type int. 
        * The first parameter, `plots`, represents the *total* number of plots in the farm. (Notice that the attribute `plots` and the parameter `plots` for this constructor are different, and represent different things!) 
        * The second parameter, `initial_planting`, represents the number of plots that that will have trees already planted in them. These initially planted plots will be trees of size 1.
        * The constructor should initialize the `plots` *attribute* to an empty `list`, and then append `initial_planting` trees of size 1. After that, the constructor should fill the rest of the plots with zeroes to indicate that they are empty!
    c. The class should define a method called `plant`.
        * This method should have a parameter of type `int`, representing the  plot index at which a tree should be planted. 
        * The tree should be size 1 when planted. If this method is called on a plot that already has a tree, the old tree will be uprooted and replaced with a new baby tree (size 1).
    d. The class should define a method called `growth`. 
        * This method should increase the size of each planted tree by 1. (Remember that unplanted plots are represented by a 0 in the `plots` list.)
    e. The class should define a method called `harvest`. 
        * This method should have a parameter `replant` of type `bool` that will determine whether this method replants trees (sets them to size 1 after harvest) or leaves the plots empty (sets them to size 0 after harvest). 
        * For this method, trees that are at least size 5 will be harvested. The method will `return` the count of how many trees were successfully harvested (type `int`).
    f. The class should *overload* the addition operator. 
        * This method should work between two objects of type `ChristmasTreeFarm`. 
        * The method should return a new `ChristmasTreeFarm` object whose size is the sum of the given `ChristmasTreeFarm`'s, and whose initial plantings are the sum of the number of planted trees in the given `ChristmasTreeFarm`s.
    e. *Check your code:* If you want to check and see if your code works, you can use the autograder. Check out the instructions below to join the autograder Gradescope if you haven't yet. (It's the same one used for QZ02 practice!) For the autograder to work, you need to save your file in your lessons folder, in a folder called "practice" and in a file called "tree_farm.py". Create the zip folder by running the command: `python -m tools.submission lessons/practice`

## Function Writing

1. Write a function called `find_courses`. Given the following `Course` class definition, `find_courses` should take in a `list[Courses]` and a `str` prerequisite to search for. The function should return a list of the `names` of each Course whose `level` is 400+ and whose `prerequisites` list contains the given string.

``` 
    class Course:
        """Models the idea of a UNC course."""
        name: str
        level: int
        prerequisites: list[str]
```

2. Write a method called `is_valid_course` for the `Course` class. The method should take in a `str` prerequisite and return a `bool` that represents whether the course’s `level` is 400+ and if its `prerequisites` list contains the given string.

3. *Check your code:* If you want to check and see if your code works, you can use the autograder. Check out the instructions below to join the autograder Gradescope if you haven't yet. (It's the same one used for QZ02 practice!) For the autograder to work, you need to save your file in your lessons folder, in a folder called "practice" and in a file called "courses.py". Create the zip folder by running the command: `python -m tools.submission lessons/practice
