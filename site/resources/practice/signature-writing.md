# Questions

## Signature Writing

The following questions will have you practice signature writing.

1. Write the *signature* for a function called `name_eval` that takes as input someone's name as a string and returns `True` if the name has an even amount of letters and `False` if it has an odd amount of letters.

2. Write the *signature* for a function called `name_size` that takes as input someone's name as a string and returns the *length* of their name as an integer.

3. Write the *signature* for a function called `gcd` that takes two floats as input and returns the integer that is their greatest common divisor.

# Solutions

## Signature Writing Solutions

1. `def name_eval(id: str) -> bool:`

*(Note that I chose to call the parameter `id`, but you could've chosen any valid name!)*

2. `def name_size(id: str) -> int:`

*(Note that I chose to call the parameter `id`, but you could've chosen any valid name!)*

3. `def gcd(number_a: float, number_b: float) -> int:`

*(Note that I chose to call the parameters `number_a` and `number_b`, but you could've chosen any valid name!)*
