# Questions

Solutions for each problem can be found at the bottom of this page.

## Conceptual Questions

1. A class definition provides a pattern for creating objects, but doesn’t make any objects itself. (T/F)
2. By convention, Python class names start with a lowercase letter. (T/F)
3. When you define a method in a class, all objects of that class have that method associated with it. (T/F)
4. The first parameter of a method is a copy of the object the method is called on called `self`. (T/F)
5. A class *definition* must come before an object of that class is *instantiated*. (T/F)
6. You must have an instance of a class (an object) to call the class’s constructor. (T/F)
7. Constructors must have the `self` parameter in their signature. (T/F)
8. Constructors must take at least one parameter other than the self parameter. (T/F)
9. Objects are passed into functions by reference. (T/F)
10. The type of an object is the same as the name of the class it is an instance of. (T/F)

## Memory Diagrams

Focus on the Recursion memory diagrams on the [practice memory diagram page](/resources/practice/MemDiagrams.html).

## Class Writing

1. This class is slightly challenging, but take it step by step! Create a `ChristmasTreeFarm` class with the following specifications:
    a. The `ChristmasTreeFarm` class should have one attribute: a `list[int]` named `plots`. 
        * Basic behavior of `plots` (you will define this later):
            * This list will hold values that represent the size of the tree planted in each plot. 
            * If the value at an index of the list is 0, then the plot at that index is empty (does not have a tree). 
            * Any value other than 0 indicates that a tree is growing in that plot!
    b. The *constructor* for the class should take two arguments: `plots: int` and `initial_planting: int`, both of type int. 
        * The first parameter, `plots`, represents the *total* number of plots in the farm. (Notice that the attribute `plots` and the parameter `plots` for this constructor are different, and represent different things!) 
        * The second parameter, `initial_planting`, represents the number of plots that that will have trees already planted in them. These initially planted plots will be trees of size 1.
        * The constructor should initialize the `plots` *attribute* to an empty `list`, and then append `initial_planting` trees of size 1. After that, the constructor should fill the rest of the plots with zeroes to indicate that they are empty!
    c. The class should define a method called `plant`.
        * This method should have a parameter of type `int`, representing the  plot index at which a tree should be planted. 
        * The tree should be size 1 when planted. If this method is called on a plot that already has a tree, the old tree will be uprooted and replaced with a new baby tree (size 1).
    d. The class should define a method called `growth`. 
        * This method should increase the size of each planted tree by 1. (Remember that unplanted plots are represented by a 0 in the `plots` list.)
    e. The class should define a method called `harvest`. 
        * This method should have a parameter `replant` of type `bool` that will determine whether this method replants trees (sets them to size 1 after harvest) or leaves the plots empty (sets them to size 0 after harvest). 
        * For this method, trees that are at least size 5 will be harvested. The method will `return` the count of how many trees were successfully harvested (type `int`).
    <!-- f. The class should *overload* the addition operator. 
        * This method should work between two objects of type `ChristmasTreeFarm`. 
        * The method should return a new `ChristmasTreeFarm` object whose size is the sum of the given `ChristmasTreeFarm`'s, and whose initial plantings are the sum of the number of planted trees in the given `ChristmasTreeFarm`s.

## Function Writing with Class Objects

1. Write a function called `find_courses`. Given the following `Course` class definition, `find_courses` should take in a `list[Courses]` and a `str` prerequisite to search for. The function should return a list of the `names` of each Course whose `level` is 400+ and whose `prerequisites` list contains the given string.

``` 
    class Course:
        """Models the idea of a UNC course."""
        name: str
        level: int
        prerequisites: list[str]
```

2. Write a method called `is_valid_course` for the `Course` class. The method should take in a `str` prerequisite and return a `bool` that represents whether the course’s `level` is 400+ and if its `prerequisites` list contains the given string.
