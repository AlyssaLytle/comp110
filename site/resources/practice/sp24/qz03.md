# Quiz Review Questions

## Conceptual Questions

### Dictionaries

1. Dictionaries in Python can have duplicate keys. (T/F)
2. Dictionaries in Python can be nested, meaning a dictionary can contain another dictionary as a value. (T/F)


### Unit Tests

1. All pytest test function names must begin with `test`. (T/F)
2. If a unit test does NOT pass, this means that one of the assertions in the test is False. (T/F)
3. Test functions should be written in a file with a name matching the file that the functions are defined in, followed by `_test.py`. (T/F)
4. Pytest is the only unit testing framework available for Python. (T/F)
5. Unit tests in Pytest are written in separate files from the code they are testing. (T/F)

### Runtime Analysis

1. A function with a big-O notation of O(n) will *always*run faster than a function with a big-O notation of O(n^2) for all input sizes. (T/F)
2. Big-O notation considers the constants and lower-order terms when analyzing the runtime of an algorithm. (T/F)
3. Big-O notation can be used to analyze both time complexity and space complexity of algorithms. (T/F)
4. Big-O notation provides a precise measurement of the actual runtime of an algorithm on a specific machine. (T/F)
5. Big-O notation accounts for variations in performance due to factors like hardware and compiler optimizations. (T/F)
6.  If an algorithm has a time complexity of O(1), it means its runtime is constant and independent of the input size. (T/F)

## Unit Tests Short Response

1. This function finds the first word in a `list` of `str` with an *even*length. 

~~~    
    def find_even(words: list[str]) -> str:
        idx: int = 0
        while idx < len(words):
            if len(words[idx]) % 2 == 0:
                return words[idx]
            idx += 1
        return ""
~~~

Fill in this unit test with a *use case*. 

~~~    
    def test_find_even_use_case() -> None:
            """ Put code here. """
~~~

2. This function *removes*the first word in a `list` of `str` with an *even*length. 

~~~    
    def remove_first_even(words: list[str]) -> None:
        idx: int = 0
        condition: bool = True
        while (idx < len(words)) and condition:
            if len(words[idx]) % 2 == 0:
                words.pop(idx)
                condition = False
            idx += 1
~~~

Fill in this unit test with a *use case*. 

~~~    
    def test_remove_first_even_use_case() -> None:
            """ Put code here. """
~~~


## Function Writing

1. Value Exists: 

* The function name is value\_exists and is called with a `dict[str,int]` and an `int` as an argument.
* The function should return a `bool`.
* The function should return `True` if the `int` exists as a value in the dictionary, and `False} otherwise.
* The function should not mutate (modify) the input dict.
* Explicitly type variables, parameters, and return types. 
* The following REPL examples demonstrate expected functionality of your `value\_exists` function:

<pre>
<div class="terminal">
>>> test_dict: dict[str,int] = {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 7, "d": 1}
>>> test_val: int = 4
>>> value_exists(test_dict, test_val)
True
>>> value_exists(test_dict, 5)
False
</div>
</pre>

2. Value Exists: 

* The function name is `plus_or_minus_n` and is called with `inp: dict[str,int]` and `n: int` as an argument.
* The function should return `None`. It instead *mutates* the input dictionary `inp`.
* The function should check if each *value* in `inp` is even or odd. If it is even, add `n` to that value. If it is odd, subtract `n`.
* Explicitly type variables, parameters, and return types. 
* The following REPL examples demonstrate expected functionality of your function:


<pre>
<div class="terminal">
>>> test_dict: dict[str,int] = {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 7, "d": 1}
>>> test_val: int = 4
>>> plus_or_minus_n(test_dict, test_val)
>>> test_dict
{"a": 6, "b": 8, "c": 3, "d": -3}
</div>
</pre>
