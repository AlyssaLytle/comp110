# Quiz Review

## Conceptual Questions

### Dictionaries

1. Dictionaries in Python can have duplicate keys. (T/F)
2. Dictionaries in Python can be nested, meaning a dictionary can contain another dictionary as a value. (T/F)


### Unit Tests

1. All pytest test function names must begin with `test`. (T/F)
2. If a unit test does NOT pass, this means that one of the assertions in the test is False. (T/F)
3. Test functions should be written in a file with a name matching the file that the functions are defined in, followed by `_test.py`. (T/F)
4. Pytest is the only unit testing framework available for Python. (T/F)
5. Unit tests in Pytest are written in separate files from the code they are testing. (T/F)

### Runtime Analysis

1. A function with a big-O notation of O(n) will *always* run faster than a function with a big-O notation of O(n^2) for all input sizes. (T/F)
2. Big-O notation considers the constants and lower-order terms when analyzing the runtime of an algorithm. (T/F)
3. Big-O notation can be used to analyze both time complexity and space complexity of algorithms. (T/F)
4. Big-O notation provides a precise measurement of the actual runtime of an algorithm on a specific machine. (T/F)
5. Big-O notation accounts for variations in performance due to factors like hardware and compiler optimizations. (T/F)
6.  If an algorithm has a time complexity of O(1), it means its runtime is constant and independent of the input size. (T/F)
