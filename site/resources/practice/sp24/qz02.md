# Questions

The quiz itself will be similar in difficulty to this practice worksheet.

Solutions for each problem can be found at the bottom of this page.


## Conceptual Questions

1. Global variables are limited to the scope of the function they are declared in. (T/F)
2. Variables can have the same name but store different values if they are defined in a different scope. (T/F)
3. Named constants should be used to store values that may change throughout the program. (T/F)
4. When using a `for...in` loop, on the first line of the loop you must specify the *type* of the variable (variable refers to `i` in `for i in nums`). (T/F)

## While loops and functions

1. Produce a memory diagram for the following code snippet, being sure to include its stack and output.  

        def main() -> None:
            """Main Function"""
            y: int = g(1)
            f(y)
            print(g(f(3)))
        
        def f(x: int) -> int:
            """Function 0"""
            if x % 2 == 0:
                print(f"{x} is even")
            else:
                x += 1
            return x
        
        def g(x: int) -> int:
            """Function 1"""
            while x % 2 == 1:
                x += 1
            return x

        main()

1.1 Why is it that `main()` is defined above `f()` and `g()`, but we are able to call `f()` and `g()` inside `main()` without errors?

1.2 On line 5, when `print(g(f(3)))` is called, is the code block inside of the `while` loop ever entered? Why or why not?

1.3 What would happen if a line was added to the end of the snipped that said `print(x)`. Why?

## While loops and functions Solution

1. <img class="img-fluid" src="/static/practice_worksheets/sp23/q2_sol.jpg" alt="The memory diagram includes a box on the top labeled Output and a box on the bottom labeled Stack, next to an area labeled Heap.
The first frame in the Stack is labeled Globals and contains the variables main, f, and g. The variable main points to a small box on the heap that says fn 1-5. The variable f points to a small box on the heap that says fn 7-13. The variable g points to a small box on the heap that says fn 15-19.
The next frame on the stack is labeled main and contains a return address and a variable y. The return address is 21 and y has a value of 2. The next frame is labeled g and contains a return address, return value, and a variable x. The return address is 2, the variable x has a value of 2 with the previous value of 1 crossed out, and the return value is 3. The next frame is labeled f and contains a return address, return value, and a variable x. The return address is 4, the variable x has a value of 2, and the return value is 2. The next frame is labeled f and contains a return address, return value, and a variable x. The return address is 5, the variable x has a value of 4 with the previous value of 3 crossed out, and the return value is 4. The final frame is labeled g and contains a return address, return value, and the variable x. The return address is 5, the variable x has a value of 4, and the return value is 4.
The output box contains a line that says (in quotes) 2 is even. Then, on the next line it says (in quotes) 4.
">

1.1 Even though `main` is defined before `f` and `g`, it isn't **called** until after `f` and `g` are defined.

1.2 No because `x = 4`, so `x % 2 == 1` is False, and therefore the code block inside is never run.

1.3 There would be an error because `x` is a local variable inside both `f` and `g`. In other words, `x` is *NOT* a global variable. Therefore, the program does not recognize that `x` exists in this context.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/static/practice-mem-diagrams/md-qz02.png" alt="The memory diagram includes a column labeled Stack, a column labeled Heap, and a column labeled Output. The stack has 3 frames in the following order from top to bottom: globals, main, and make underscore word. 
In the Globals frame there are 2 items. First is the label `main` pointing to a function on the heap from lines 1-5. The label make underscore word points to a function on the heap from lines 8-21. 
The main frame has 4 items, RA, RV, strings, and word. The return address is 25 and the return value is None. The variable `strings` pointing to a list in the Heap. The list is labeled list bracket str close bracket and has 4 rows and 2 columns. The first column has the indices 0, 1, 2, and 3 and the second column has the values 'hey', 'o', 'eh', and 'e'. Finally, the `main` stack frame has the variable `word` with the value of quote H E Y O E H end quote. 
The make underscore word frame has 5 items, RA, RV, root, word, and i. Make underscore word has a return address of 4 and a return value of quote H E Y O E H end quote. It has the variable `root` pointing to the same list in the heap as the variable strings. There is another variable `word` with the value of quote H E Y O E H end quote and a variable i with the value of 3. Finally, in the output column is the string H E Y O E H.">

<img class="img-fluid" src="/static/practice_worksheets/fa21/qz02-solution12n.png" alt="The memory diagram has three columns labeled stack, heap and output. The stack has 5 frames labeled from top to bottom, in the following order: globals, main, create, create, and increase. 
The globals frame has three labels: create, increase, and main. Create is pointing to a function on the heap from lines 4-11, increase points to a function on the heap from lines 14-20, and main points to a function on the heap from lines 23-31. 
The main frame has 4 items, including the RA, RV, and two variables list underscore 1 and list underscore 2. The return address is 31 and the return value is None. list underscore 2 points to a list on the heap labeled list open bracket int close bracket with 3 rows and two columns.

The first row has the index 0 on the left and the previous value of 0 crossed out and a final value of 2. Index 1 has the previous value of 1 crossed out and a final value of 3. Index 2 has the previous value of 2 crossed out and the final value of 4.
