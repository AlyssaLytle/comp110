# Questions

The quiz itself will be similar in difficulty to this practice worksheet.

Solutions for each problem can be found at the bottom of this page.


## Functions Conceptual Questions

1. *Global* variables are limited to the scope of the function they are declared in. (T/F)
2. Variables can have the same name but store different values if they are defined in a different scope. (T/F)
3. Named constants should be used to store values that may change throughout the program. (T/F)
4. When using a `for...in` loop, on the first line of the loop you must specify the *type* of the variable (variable refers to `i` in `for i in nums`). (T/F)

## for Loops

1.1 Rewrite the following code snippet with same functionality using a `for ... in` loop.
1.2 Rewrite the following code snippet with same functionality using a `for ... in range(...)` loop.

```
    stats: list[int] = [7, 8, 9]
    index: int = 0
    total: int = 100
    while index < len(stats):
        total -= stats[index]
        index += 1
```

## Unit Tests Conceptual Questions

1. All pytest test function names must begin with `test_`. (T/F)
2. If a unit test does NOT pass, this means that one of the assertions in the test is False. (T/F)
3. Test functions should be written in a file with a name  followed by `_test.py`. (T/F)
4. Pytest is the only unit testing framework available for Python. (T/F)
5. Unit tests in Pytest are written in separate files from the code they are testing. (T/F)

## Unit Test Writing


1. This function finds the first word in a `list` of `str` with an *even*length. 

~~~    
    def find_even(words: list[str]) -> str:
        idx: int = 0
        while idx < len(words):
            if len(words[idx]) % 2 == 0:
                return words[idx]
            idx += 1
        return ""
~~~

Fill in this unit test with a *use case*. 

~~~    
    def test_find_even_use_case() -> None:
            """ Put code here. """
~~~

2. This function *removes* the first word in a `list` of `str` with an *even* length. 

~~~    
    def remove_first_even(words: list[str]) -> None:
        idx: int = 0
        condition: bool = True
        while (idx < len(words)) and condition:
            if len(words[idx]) % 2 == 0:
                words.pop(idx)
                condition = False
            idx += 1
~~~

Fill in this unit test with a *use case*. 

~~~    
    def test_remove_first_even_use_case() -> None:
            """ Put code here. """
~~~

# Solutions

## Functions Conceptual Questions Solutions

1. False
2. True
3. False
4. False


## for Loop Solutions

1.1
```
    stats: list[int] = [7, 8, 9]
    total: int = 100
    for elem in stats:
        total -= elem
```

1.2
```
    stats: list[int] = [7, 8, 9]
    total: int = 100
    for index in range(0, len(stats)):
        total -= stats[index]
```

## Function Writing Solutions

Note:  Your solution does not need to be identical to these, these are just examples of one of many possible solutions.

1.
```
    def odd_and_even(list1: list[int]) -> list[int]:
        """Find the odd elements with even indexes."""
        i: int = 0
        list2: list[int] = []

        while i < len(list1):
            if list1[i] % 2 == 1 and i % 2 == 0:
                list2.append(list1[i])
            i += 1

        return list2
```


<!-- 2.
```
    def value_exists(inp_dict: dict[str,int], val: int) -> bool:
        """Return true if val is in inp_dict"""
        exists: bool = False
        for elem in inp_dict:
            if inp_dict[elem] == val:
                exists = True
        return exists
``` -->

2.
```
    def short_words(inp_list: list[str]) -> list[str]:
        """Filter out the shorter words"""
        ret_list: list[str] = []
        for x in inp_list:
            if len(x) < 5:
                ret_list.append(x)
            else:
                print(f"{x} is too long!")
        return ret_list
```

## Unit Tests Conceptual Questions Solutions


1. True
2. True
3. True
4. False. It is the one we use for this class, but there are other frameworks!
5. True

## Unit Test Writing Solutions
These can have many possible answers! Here is just one example.

1.

~~~    
    def test_find_even_use_case() -> None:
            test_input: list[str] = ["Hello", "Hi", "Howdy", "Hiya"]
            assert find_even(test_input) == "Hi"
~~~


2. 

~~~    
    def test_remove_first_even_use_case() -> None:
        test_input: list[str] = ["Hello", "Hi", "Howdy", "Hiya"]
        remove_first_even(test_input)
        assert test_input == ["Hello", "Howdy", "Hiya"]
~~~
