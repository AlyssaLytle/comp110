# Questions

The quiz itself will be similar in difficulty to these practice questions. In addition to these questions, you should review all of your lesson responses on Gradescope. The kinds of questions you responded to on Gradescope will also be on the quiz. 

Solutions for each problem can be found at the bottom of this page. (But if you're unsure, before looking up the solution, try figuring it out on your own or testing it out in Visual Studio!)

## Data Types
1. `str` literals in Python can be surrounded in either single-quote characters (`'like this'`) or double-quote characters (`"like this"`), though in COMP110 we prefer the double-quotes. (T/F)
2. `TRUE` and `FALSE` are valid bool values in Python. (T/F)
3. An `int` literal can begin with a zero, but cannot end with a zero. (T/F)
4. What function can we use to identify the type classification of any object in Python?

## Expressions
1. What is the resulting *value* and *data type* of the following expression? `int("20")`
2. What is the resulting *value* and *data type* of the following expression? `str(2023) + str(2023)`
3.	What is the resulting value of the following expression?
` type(9 / len( str(110)) `
4. What is the resulting value of the following expression? `"440" + "20"`
5. What value of x would cause the following expression to evaluate to `True`?
` (3 + x) == (55 % 2 ** 4) `
6. What value does the following expression result in, and what is its type? `2 + 2 / 2 ** (2 * 0)`
7.	Using subscription syntax and concatenation, write an expression that evaluates to `"tar"` using the following string: `â€œSaturday"`.
8.  What data type do expressions with *relational operators* typically evaluate to?

## Conditionals
1. Every `if` statement must be followed by a paired `else` branch. (T/F)
2. Lines contained in an `else` branch in Python do not have to be indented. (T/F)
3. You can name a variable `else` in your program without Python confusing your variable's name and the `else` keyword. (If you are unsure, this is a good one to try yourself!) (T/F)

4. All subquestions of this problem will refer to this code snippet:

        x: int = int(input("Pick a number: "))
        y: int = 10
        z: int = 2
        x = x - 1
        if x < 10:
            print("A")
        else:
            if (x % z) == 0:
                print ("B")
        if x == (y + z):
            print("C")
        else: 
            print("D")

For the following subquestions, answer with a valid input value for `x` that would cause the given letter to print. It is OK for your input to cause other letters to print as well.
If there is no such value, write "Unreachable".

4.1 `A`

4.2 `B`

4.3 `C`

4.4 `D`

Now, answer with a valid input value for `x` that
would cause the *exact* given letter(s) to print (no other letters). 
If there is no such value, write "Unreachable".  
4.5 

`A` <br>
`C`

4.6 

`B` <br>
`C`


4.7 

`C`


4.8 

`D`

5.1. `((not False) and True) == True`  
5.2. `(not False) or (True and False)`  
5.3. `True and (7 < 3 * 4 / 6)`

## While Loops Basic

1. Given the following code snippet, what is the printed output once it completes?  

        """Loops Practice!"""

        x: int = 0
        y: int = 3
        z: str = "1"

        while x < y:
            z = z + str(y) + str(x)
            x = x + 1

        print(x)
        print(y)
        print(z)

2. Given the following code snippet, what is the printed output once it completes?  

        """Loops Practice!"""

        x: int = 10
        result: str = ""

        while x >= 0:
            if x % 3 > 0:
                result = result + str(x)
            else:
                result = str(x) + result
            x = x - 1

        print(result)

<!-- ## While Loops + Functions 
1. Produce a memory diagram for the following code snippet, being sure to include its stack and output.  

        WORD: str = "happy"
        l1_idx: int = 0
        l2_idx: int = 0
        t1: str = ""
        t2: str = ""
        n_appearances: int = 0

        while l1_idx < len(WORD):
            t1 = WORD[l1_idx]
            n_appearances = 1
            l2_idx = 0

            while l2_idx < len(WORD):
                t2 = WORD[l2_idx]

                if (t1 == t2) and (l1_idx != l2_idx):
                    n_appearances = n_appearances + 1
                l2_idx = l2_idx + 1
            print(f"{WORD[l1_idx]} appears {n_appearances} times.")
            l1_idx = l1_idx + 1

1.1 What would happen if `while l1_idx < len(WORD)` in line 8 was replaced with `while l1_idx < len(WORD) - 1`? Why?

1.2 What would happen if `l2_idx=0` was moved to inside the second while loop? In other words, what if lines 11-13 were changed to:

    while l2_idx < len(WORD):
        l2_idx = 0

1.3 What would happen if, in line 16, `if (t1 == t2) and (l1_idx != l2_idx):` was replaced with `if (t1 == t2):`? Why?

1.4 What would happen if line 18 (`l2_idx = l2_idx + 1`) was removed? Why?

1.5. What would happen if the `<` symbol in line 8 was replaced with `<=`? (In other words, what if it was changed to `while l1_idx <= len(WORD):`)? Why?

2. Produce a memory diagram for the following code snippet, being sure to include its stack and output.  

        def main() -> None:
            """Main Function"""
            y: int = g(1)
            f(y)
            print(g(f(3)))
        
        def f(x: int) -> int:
            """Function 0"""
            if x % 2 == 0:
                print(f"{x} is even")
            else:
                x += 1
            return x
        
        def g(x: int) -> int:
            """Function 1"""
            while x % 2 == 1:
                x += 1
            return x

        main()

2.1 Why is it that `main()` is defined above `f()` and `g()`, but we are able to call `f()` and `g()` inside `main()` without errors?

2.2 On line 5, when `print(g(f(3)))` is called, is the code block inside of the `while` loop ever entered? Why or why not?

2.3 What would happen if a line was added to the end of the snipped that said `print(x)`. Why?

(We do not *require* that you write out all interim values as long as the initial and final values are correct like in the solution below. However, writing the interim values will help for practice purposes and to avoid mistakes!)

">

**Here's a link to a [video of the solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNuPjnq-UE)!**

1.1 "y appears 1 times." would not print. This is because `l1_idx` will not enter the while loop for `l1_idx = 4`. (For more practice, it'd be good to diagram this instance out to see how it would impact the final values of other variables.)

1.2 An infinite loop would occur because `l2_idx` would always equal `1` when returning to the top of the loop, and therefore `l2_idx < len(WORD)` will always be True.

1.3 If `l1_idx != l2_idx` is no longer required, this means that each letter can count itself twice. For example, `WORD[0] == WORD[0]` is true, so `n_appearances` for `"h"` would increase to `2`.

1.4 There would be an infinite loop because `l2_idx` will never increase, and therefore `l2_idx < len(WORD)` will always be True.

1.5 There would be an index error because there would be the case where `l1_idx = 5`, so on line 9 `WORD[5]` would be searching for the element at index 5 in `"happy"`, when the indexes only go up to 4.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/static/practice_worksheets/sp23/q2_sol.jpg" alt="The memory diagram includes a box on the top labeled Output and a box on the bottom labeled Stack, next to an area labeled Heap.
The first frame in the Stack is labeled Globals and contains the variables main, f, and g. The variable main points to a small box on the heap that says fn 1-5. The variable f points to a small box on the heap that says fn 7-13. The variable g points to a small box on the heap that says fn 15-19.
The next frame on the stack is labeled main and contains a return address and a variable y. The return address is 21 and y has a value of 2. The next frame is labeled g and contains a return address, return value, and a variable x. The return address is 2, the variable x has a value of 2 with the previous value of 1 crossed out, and the return value is 3. The next frame is labeled f and contains a return address, return value, and a variable x. The return address is 4, the variable x has a value of 2, and the return value is 2. The next frame is labeled f and contains a return address, return value, and a variable x. The return address is 5, the variable x has a value of 4 with the previous value of 3 crossed out, and the return value is 4.

The output box contains a line that says (in quotes) 2 is even. Then, on the next line it says (in quotes) 4.
">

2.1 Even though `main` is defined before `f` and `g`, it isn't **called** until after `f` and `g` are defined.

2.2 No because `x = 4`, so `x % 2 == 1` is False, and therefore the code block inside is never run.

2.3 There would be an error because `x` is a local variable inside both `f` and `g`. In other words, `x` is *NOT* a global variable. Therefore, the program does not recognize that `x` exists in this context. -->
