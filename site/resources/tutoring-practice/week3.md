# Questions
These questions might not be in the same format as quizzes. Don't hesitate to bring them to the Tutoring section for help.

### Functions
1. Answer the 1.1 and 1.2 based on the following codes:
~~~
def foo(x):
  return x + 1

def bar(x):
  return x * 2

print(foo(bar(3))) 
~~~
1.1 Do you know from the above codes, which function has been called the first? Foo or bar?

1.2 What will be the final lineâ€™s ouput.

2. This is a open end question, as we have learned the creation of function, can you think of the benefits of using functions in programming?

3. Regarding the naming convention or naming rule for naming a function in Python, identify the following statements of either true or false.
- The name could start with a number, 1, 2, 3, etc
- The name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- The name can contain any characters as long as the first one is a letter or an underscore.
- The name can be a reserved keyword in Python which in capticalized. (such as DEF, IF, FOR)
- It is encourage to have the first letter of the name capitalized as it is also the convention we followed in daily writing. 

4. What is the difference between a function definition and a function call?

5. 
5.1 Write a function called `odd_or_even`. Given a list of `ints` and one `string` of either `even` or `odd`, the function will return a substring contains only the even or odd numbers based on the inputed `string`.

5.2 Write a function called `even_and3`. Given a list of `int`s, the function should return a substring with numbers that are either `even` or at the `index of multiple of 3`.

5.3 Based on the codes you wrote for 5.1 and 5.2, could you identify the following elements with the codes? 
a. return type declaration
b. arguments
c. parameters
d. returned value
e. function signature

6. What is the difference between a return statement and a print statement in a function?

7. What is the purpose of the global keyword in a function?

8. What is the scope of a variable in a function? (Hints: Think of global scope and function scope)


9. What is the output of this code?
~~~
x = 10

def foo():
  x = 20
  print(x)

foo()
print(x)
~~~

10. What is the output of this code?
~~~
x = 10

def foo():
  global x
  x = 20
  print(x)

foo()
print(x)
~~~

11. What is the output of this code?
~~~
x = 10

def foo():
  x = 20
  def bar():
    global x
    x = 30
  bar()
  print(x)

foo()
print(x)
~~~
