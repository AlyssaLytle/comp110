Graduation Year: 2024

Semesters on Team 110: 6

Why I <3 Team 110: When I had to set up the projector at Hack 110, two other 110 TAs helped me fidget with the remote and read an instructional email. We didn't end up figuring it out, but my team members stuck with me all the way through——friendship and support is endless in Team 110.

Fun Fact: I run an 11-minute mile!

## Responsibilities

I help make the autograders for student assignments——sometimes it's scary sometimes it isn't.

I also help refactor the semester's schedule, create quizzes, and update or roll out new exercises.  



## Goals

Officially replace the Wordle exercises with our new Battleship series (designed by Audrey Salmon and Camilla Fratta). 

Come up with some other assignments to bring in next semester——maybe a Buzzfeed quiz or a recursive variant of Turtle.
