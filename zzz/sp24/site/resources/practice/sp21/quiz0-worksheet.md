# Questions

## Booleans and Conditionals
1.	What values of x and y would cuase the following expression to evaluate to `True`?

    `x % 3 == 2 and y < 10 and x + y == 15 and y % 2 != 0`

2. Write the boolean value each expression evaluates to:
    i. `(8 * 3) == (50 % 6 * 12)`
    ii. `not False and True == True`
    iii. `not False or True and False`
    iv. `true and 7 < 3  * 4 / 6`
    v. `not 4 < 10 or False != True`

3.	With the following code snippet, what output will appear on the screen when each of the following values is used for x and y?
