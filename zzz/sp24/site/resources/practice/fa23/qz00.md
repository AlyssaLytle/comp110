# Quiz Concepts

Quiz 01 will cover both the concepts that would've been on Quiz 00 and Quiz 01. (However, it won't be any longer than a typical quiz.)

You can find a full list of concepts [here](/resources/qz01-concepts.html).

# Questions

The quiz itself will be similar in difficulty but longer in length than these practice questions. In addition to these questions, you should review all of your lesson responses on Gradescope. The kinds of questions you responded to on Gradescope will also be on the quiz. 

Solutions for each problem can be found at the bottom of this page. (But if you're unsure, before looking up the solution, try it out in Visual Studio!)

## Memory Diagrams
1.	Produce a memory diagram for the following code snippet, being sure to include its stack and output.

2. Produce a memory diagram for the following code snippet, being sure to include its stack and output.

## Data Types
3. `str` literals in Python can be surrounded in either single-quote characters (`'like this'`) or double-quote characters (`"like this"`), though in COMP110 we prefer the latter. (T/F)
4. `TRUE` and `FALSE` are valid bool values in Python. (T/F)
5. An `int` literal can begin with a zero, but cannot end with a zero. (T/F)
6. What function can we use to identify the type classification of any object in Python? 
7. What is the resulting data type of the following expression? `int("20")`

## Expressions
8.	What is the evaluation of the following expression?
` type(9 / len( str(110)) `
9. What is the result of the following expression? `"440" + "20"`
10. What value of x would cause the following expression to evaluate to `True`?
` (3 + x) == (55 % 2 ** 4) `
11. What value does the following expression result in, and what is its type? `2 + 2 / 2 ** (2 * 0)`
12.	Using subscription syntax and concatenation, write an expression that evaluates to `"tar"` using the following string: `“the brown, lazy dog!"`.
13.  What data type do expressions with relational operators evaluate to?
14.  What does the following expression evaluate to? `int("10" + "40") > 100 * 2`

## Conditionals
15. Every `if` statement must be followed by a paired `else` branch. (T/F)
16. Lines contained in an `else` branch in Python do not have to be indented. (T/F)
17. You can name a variable `else` in your program without Python confusing your variable's name and the `else` keyword. (If you are unsure, this is a good one to try yourself!) (T/F)
18. All subquestions of this problem will refer to this code snippet:

        x: str = int(input("Pick a number: "))
        y: int = 10
        z: int = 2
        x = x - 1
        if x < 10:
            print("A")
        elif (x % z) == 0:
            print ("B")
        if x == (y + z):
            print("C")
        else: 
            print("D")

For the following subquestions, answer with a valid input value for `x` that would cause the given letter to print. It is OK for your input to cause other letters to print as well.
If there is no such value, write "Unreachable".

18.1 `A`

18.2 `B`

18.3 `C`

18.4 `D`

Now, answer with a valid input value for `x` that
would cause the *exact* given letter(s) to print (no other letters). 
If there is no such value, write "Unreachable".  
18.5 

    A
    C

18.6 

    B
    C

18.7 

    C

18.8 

    D
