For this course, we expect your laptop meets the <a href="https://cci.unc.edu/new-students/minimum-laptop-requirement/" target="_blank">Carolina Computing Initiative</a> standards.

Updating your operating system is a best practice to ensure you not only have the latest security updates, but also the latest software development features which are packaged along with them.

## Windows 10 / 11

Check your Windows version number before continuing:

Press `Windows Button + R`, type `winver`, and press `Ok` or `Enter`.

Confirm you are running the May 2020 release of Windows 10, or later, by looking for:

- Version 2004 or later
- Build 19041 or later

If your installed version of Windows is not up-to-date, visit the following URL and look for the Windows 10 May 2020 Update area. Follow the steps needed to upgrade your operating system:
