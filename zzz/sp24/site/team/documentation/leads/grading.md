## Responsibilities

1. Managing quiz grading and ensuring quizzes are graded efficiently
2. Delegating grading of more complex assignments that require more people on the team to grade
3. Assembling a grading team who will have more grading responsibilities over the course of the semester

## Goals

1. I would like to try and keep quiz turnaround to at most a week
2. At the end of each week I would like to have an update of what is not graded and develop a prioritization system to manage what needs to be graded next
3. With new assignments coming on this semester I would like to work with curriculum lead to make sure rubrics are the most user friendly and understandable for students when they get their results back
