Introduction to Computing and Data Science, or COMP110 is a beginning course to computer science offered at UNC Chapel Hill. The course aims to introduce students to programming and data science from a computational perspective, using the Python programming language. There is an emphasis on modern applications in society, allowing students  to gain experience with problem decomposition, algorithms for data analysis, abstraction design, and ethics in computing. Foundational concepts include data types, sequences, boolean logic, control flow, functions/methods, classes/objects, input/output, data organization, transformations, and visualizations. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented many challenges to folks all over the world. When it came to education, many classes transferred to an online-learning format. However, a silver lining in this new way of teaching revealed an opportunity: COMP110 lectures were pre-recorded or streamed live on Youtube, freely and publicly available. Head on over to the course tab to begin, and [don't forget to subscribe on YouTube to follow along](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX2Dop_X6MtbcmEVkbjMpSA).
