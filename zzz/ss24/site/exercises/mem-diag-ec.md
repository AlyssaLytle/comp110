# How It Works

This extra credit will only apply to your quiz if you score below a 60. You can earn up to 5 extra credit percentage points for the quiz!

I also highly recommend this assignment if you are struggling with memory diagrams in general!


# Assignment Description

The point of this assignment is to help you come up with a general strategy for making a memory diagram. You are going to type up a generalized step-by-step guide for making a memory diagram of a block of code.

You can upload this as either a .pdf or type the text directly into the text box on gradescope!

## Guidelines

* Try and use an "if...then..." format. E.g. "If I see a function definition, I do this..." 
* Break it into two parts: how to handle things in globals, and how to handle function calls. There will be some repetitive aspects (e.g. how you handle a new variable in globals vs how you handle it in a function call frame is sometimes similar)

### Some questions your guide should address:

* How do I handle the instantiation of a `str`, `int`, `bool`, or `float`?
* How do I handle the instantiation of `list`?
* How do I handle updating/reassigning variable values?
* How do I handle function definitions?
* How do I handle function calls?
* Within functions, how do I handle variables that are on the heap? (In other words, what if an argument to my function call is a list. How do I show that in the diagram?)
* What do I do if I see a `print` statment?
* What do I do if I see a `return` statement?
* What if my return value is something on the heap?
