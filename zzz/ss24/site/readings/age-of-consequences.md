In this assignment, you are tasked with reading and reflecting on a computer science paper featured in the 2015 Computing within Limits Workshop. The workshop is focused on exploring the role of computing in human societies affected by real-world limits, ecological and otherwise. More information about the workshop and other works published can be found [here](https://computingwithinlimits.org/2021/). 

The paper is titled "Information Systems for the Age of Consequences", and it explores issues related to sustainble and responsible computing. 

## Why is this research important? Why should we care?

Computing technologies are all around us. As budding computer scientists, it is our responsiblity to be informed about the ways that computer science can be put to use to make the world a better place, but also where it can cause harm. It is important to think critically about when and how techonlogy is the answer to our problems and when it is not.
