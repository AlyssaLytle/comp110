In this assignment, you are tasked with reading and reflecting on a chapter out of the book "Weapons of Math Destruction" by Cathy O'Neil. The chapter is titled **Bomb Parts -- What is a Model?** and it gives an introduction of what it means to think like a data scientist. The chapter also describes the nature of the models that are behind the predictive algorithms powering the technologies all around us.

Throughout the chapter, the author uses the acronym "WMD" which stands for "Weapon of Math Destruction," a term she coined to describe harmful and predatory algorithms.
