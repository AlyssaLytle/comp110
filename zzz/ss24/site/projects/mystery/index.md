## Introduction

Welcome to a supplemental COMP110 epic mystery halloween adventure!!! Right off the bat, note that this is NOT a graded assignment for the class. This adventure is for those seeking a little spooky challenge outside of the normal duties of a COMP110'er.

In this project, you will use your programming skills to deduce clues and explore UNC's campus in search of QR codes that will take you through each part of the mystery.
