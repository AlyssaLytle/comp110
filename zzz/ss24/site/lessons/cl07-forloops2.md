# Instructions

Modify the `sum` function in `sum.py` from Tuesday's virtual lesson so that instead of using a `while` loop, it uses a `for ... in range(0,len(xs))` loop.

Then run the unit tests you wrote on Tuesday to ensure that your modification worked!

Upload your `sum.py` file to the autograder on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). **You do not have to compress anything into a .zip file this time! Just upload the one sum.py file!**

(If you want to keep your old version of the `sum` function, just rename it something like `sum_old`.)
