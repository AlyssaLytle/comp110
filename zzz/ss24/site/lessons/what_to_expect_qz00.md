Quiz 00 will be untimed and open all day Friday 6/24, from 9:00am until 11:59pm. 

This is not like a typical quiz in that it will be untimed and is weighted less than the others. It is a chance to learn the quiz format for this class, get feedback on environment diagrams, and to assess how you are doing in the class so far.
