<!-- ## What to expect on QZ00?

Quiz 00 will cover concepts from all lessons, including today's, and important points of the syllabus. Its format will be _very much like_ a longer version of this class' Gradescope assignment. It will be taken on Gradescope remotely, but will be timed with 75 minutes by default.

An additional e-mail will go out by tomorrow (Friday, August 27th) with more specific details on the quiz and how to prepare. For now, you should focus on completing today's lessons and Exercise 01. Although Exercise 01 is not due until the evening of the quiz, you are STRONGLY encouraged to complete it as preparation for the quiz. -->

<!-- ## Today's Responsess on Gradescope

Today's video responses are contained in a single lesson on Gradescope and correspond to the videos below. You should watch them in order and make it a point to pause and attempt each item _before_ watching the solution.

If you do not complete all videos in one sitting, you can reopen your submission on Gradescope to finish it out before the deadline. To do so, open your submission and look for a button in the bottom of your screen for "Create New Submission". -->

In COMP110 this summer, you are required to scan pencil/paper submissions for diagrams and are not allowed to digitally diagram on an iPad or using other diagramming software unless you have a specific accomodation from ARS. We will penalize 25% off on diagrams that were made using digital tools and not scanned from pen/paper.
