# Unit Test Challenge Question

For this challenge question, you are going to *test* the `zip` function you just wrote in the previous challenge question!

## Part 0. Setup

Start by opening your workspace in Visual Studio. Right click on the "lessons" folder and select "add file". Your file will be named `zip_test.py`.

Set up your document by adding the docstring:
`"""Test my zip function"""` and initializing the `__author__` variable with your PID.

Also don't forget to import your `zip` function from `lessons.zip`!

## Part 1. unit tests

Write 3 unit tests for `zip`. Remember that a unit test function name starts with `test_`.

The 3 unit tests should consist of:

* One edge case
* Two use cases

Include descriptive function names and docstrings, so that it captures what is being tested.


## Submission

Create a .zip file by running the following command in your terminal:

```python -m tools.submission lessons```

(For this assignment, you'll have to submit your entire lessons folder!)

Then, drag and drop that .zip file into Gradescope!
